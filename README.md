🍎 Fruit Classification with Logistic Regression:

This project uses Logistic Regression to classify fruits based on physical characteristics such as mass, width, height, and color score. It also includes complete model evaluation using accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, confusion matrix, and classification report.

📌 Overview:

- Dataset: fruits.csv
- Objective: Predict the fruit label based on physical measurements
- Model: Logistic Regression (scikit-learn)
- Evaluation Metrics: Accuracy, F1 Score, Precision, Recall, Confusion Matrix

🧾 Features Used:

Feature :	Description
mass: 	Mass of the fruit (grams)
width: 	Width of the fruit (cm)
height: 	Height of the fruit (cm)
color_score: 	Color score of the fruit

⚙️ How It Works:

- Load the dataset using pandas
- Preprocess the data by selecting features and target
- Split the data into training and testing sets
- Train the Logistic Regression model with max_iter=10000 to ensure convergence
- Evaluate the model using key classification metrics

 📈 Evaluation Metrics:
 
The model is evaluated using:

✅ Accuracy
📊 F1 Score (weighted)
🔁 Recall (weighted)
🎯 Precision (weighted)
📉 Confusion Matrix
📝 Classification Report

💡 Learnings:

- Applied Logistic Regression for multi-class classification
- Practiced data preprocessing and train-test splitting
- Gained experience in using model evaluation metrics
- Modularized code with reusable functions
